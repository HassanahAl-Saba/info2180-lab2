            An airplane or aeroplane (informally plane) is a powered, fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller or rocket engine. 
            Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. 
            The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research.
            Worldwide, commercial aviation transports more than four billion passengers annually on airliners and transports more than 200 billion tonne-kilometers of cargo annually, which is less than 1% of the world's cargo movement.
            An airliner is a type of aircraft for transporting passengers and air cargo. 
            Such aircraft are most often operated by airlines.
            Although the definition of an airliner can vary from country to country, an airliner is typically defined as an airplane intended for carrying multiple passengers or cargo in commercial service.

            Most airplanes are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, but some are designed to be remotely or computer-controlled such as drones.
            The Wright brothers invented and flew the first airplane in 1903, recognized as "the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight".
            They built on the works of George Cayley dating from 1799, when he set forth the concept of the modern airplane (and later built and flew models and successful passenger-carrying gliders).

        <h2>Hassanah's Blog on General Aviation</h2>
        <h4><i>October 4, 2020 by Hassanah Al-Saba</i></h4>

            The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines civil aviation aircraft operations in three categories: General Aviation (GA), Aerial Work (AW) and Commercial Air Transport (CAT).
            General aviation thus represents the 'private transport' and recreational components of aviation.
            It also includes activities surrounding aircraft homebuilding, flight training, flying clubs, and aerial application, as well as forms of charitable and humanitarian transportation. 
            Private flights are made in a wide variety of aircraft: light and ultra-light aircraft, sport aircraft, business aircraft (like private jets), gliders and helicopters.
            Flights can be carried out under both visual flight (VFR) and instrument flight (IFR) rules, and can use controlled airspace with permission.

            Aerial work operations are separated from general aviation by ICAO in its definition.
            These activities include agriculture, construction, photography, surveying, observation and patrol, search and rescue, and aerial advertisement.
            However ICAO has considered officially extending the definition of general aviation to include aerial work to reflect common usage and for statistical purposes.
